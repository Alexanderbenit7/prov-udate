This repository contains all the files prepared by the Lime Team as part of the assessed work for the module *Understanding Data and Their Environment* in the MSc Data Science 2024/25 programme at the University of Manchester. The main objective of this work is to *formalize the provenance* of a survey that collected individual-level information about land ownership in the United Kingdom, as well as to construct an indicator measuring wealth based on the collected data.

The repository is organized as follows:

- _dataLime.xlsx_: Data collected after survey implementation
- _metadata.xlsx_: Metadata with information about the survey and its attributes
- _indicator.pdf_: Presentation explaining the construction of the indicator
- _lime.provn_: Code for provenance modeling
- _PROVNgraph.pdf_: Provenance graph
